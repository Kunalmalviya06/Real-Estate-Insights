# Real Estate Insights: An Analytical Dive into Property Data

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze housing data from two datasets: Flats and Houses, to derive insights regarding pricing trends, area comparisons, and furnishings. By understanding these aspects, stakeholders can make informed decisions related to property investments and market strategies.

## Overview
This analysis focuses on various attributes of housing data, including price, area, number of bedrooms, and furnishings. The insights gathered from the analysis will help in understanding market dynamics and customer preferences.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data from two datasets: `flats_df` and `houses_df`, collected from the 99 Acres website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and extracting relevant information from string fields (e.g., extracting numerical values from text).
3. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Analyzed average prices based on the number of bedrooms.
   - Compared areas of furnished vs. unfurnished houses.
   - Identified the most common number of floors in listed houses.
4. **Visualization**: Created visual representations of the analysis results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
